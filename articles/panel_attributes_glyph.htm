<h1>Glyph - Attributes Panel</h1>

<p><i>(Glyph Edit, Components, and Ligatures Pages)</i></p>

<p>
	When no shape is selected, the Attributes Panel shows attributes for the currently
	selected Glyph.
</p>

<h2>Bulk-transform glyph shapes</h2>

<p>
	If there are more than one shape in the glyph, bulk transform controls are shown 
	that will change all the shapes in the glyph.
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		<b>X/Y</b> - 
		the farthest-left (x) and topmost (y) Position of the glyph
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>Width / Height</b> - 
		the overall width and height of the glyph
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>Lock Aspect Ratio</b> - 
		this will force width and height changes to happen proportionally
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>Flip Vertical / Flip Horizontal</b> - 
		flip the entire glyph
	</li>
</ul>

<h2>Width Metrics</h2>

<p>
	These metrics are used for exporting a font file
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		<b>Glyph Width</b> - 
		by default, Glyphr Studio automatically calculates the width of a glyph. By unchecking the
		'automatically calculate' checkbox, you can manually set the glyph width.
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>Left and Right Side Bearing</b> - 
		This is a small amount of space that is automatically added before and after all
		glyphs. There is a global default that is applied to all glyphs, but
		if you want to specify a custom side bearing for a certain glyph, uncheck
		the 'use default' checkbox here.
	</li>
</ul>
