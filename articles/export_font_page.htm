<h1>Export Font Page</h1>

<p>
For Beta 5, Glyphr Studio can
export an SVG font straight from your browser. In the future, Glyphr Studio will
be able to export Open Type files (.otf), and possibly some other formats. 
Luckily, there are some free services online that will allow you to convert a
SVG Font to whatever format you'd like. So, for now, export a SVG Font and convert
it to a 'real' font elsewhere. We're working on making this more streamlined
in the future.

<b>TTX support was deprecated in Beta 4, and removed in Beta 5</b>
 - if you super &lt;3 Glyphr Studio plus TTX,
you'll have to stick with Beta 4. Them's the breaks.
