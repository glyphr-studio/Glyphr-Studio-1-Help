<h1>Starting a New Project</h1>

<p>
	The first page you get when you open Glyphr Studio is the Open Projects page.  There are a few 
	ways you can start working on a project.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
	<b>Drag and drop to load a file</b> - this allows you to load a pre-existing file.  The two types 
	of files that are accepted are a Glyphr Studio Project File (with a .txt suffix), or a SVG Font 
	File (with a .svg suffix).<br>
	Please note, a SVG Font is a specific format of a SVG File.  SVG Fonts have a certain structure 
	that Glyphr Studio can import.  Generic SVG Files cannot be loaded from the Open Projects page.  
	If you have SVG outlines you want to use, create a new project and import your individual SVG 
	outlines via the <a class="articlelink" href="page_import_svg.html">Import SVG Page</a>.
</li>
<li>
	<b>Start a new Glyphr Project</b> - this will create a blank project with default settings.  
	You can input a name here if you want, but you can change it at any time from the 
	<a class="articlelink" href="page_font_settings.html">Font Settings Page</a>.
</li>
</ul>
