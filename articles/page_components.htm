<h1>Components Page</h1>

<p>
	Components are glyphs that you define once, and can be added to many other glyphs.  If you edit 
	the original Root Component, it updates all the Component Instances in the other glyphs 
	where it was inserted.  
</p>
	
<p>
	For example, you could define an 'o' shape, and insert a Component Instance to each of the glyphs 
	'abdgopq'.  This can help in the beginning phases of font design to rough out common shapes
	across an entire set of glyphs.
</p>

<p>
	The Components Page is where you can define stand-alone Root Components.  But, you can actually 
	use any Glyph or Ligature as if it were a Root Component.  Inserting a Component Instance to a 
	Glyph is just creating a link to another Root Component, Glyph, or Ligature.
	Editing a Component uses all the common <a class="articlelink" href="editing_shape_editing.html">shape 
	editing</a> concepts.
</p>

<h2>Linking and Un-linking</h2>

<p>
	Components can be added to a glyph from the Components Page, or a Component can be added to 
	whatever glyph you are current working on.  Once you have a Component Instance in a glyph, 
	it can be un-linked. This essentially makes a copy of the original Component, transforms it, 
	and places it in the glyph as a set of regular shapes.
</p>

<p>
	Alternatively, if you are creating a glyph and decide you would like to use it 
	in other glyphs as a Component, you can do so by navigating to the glyph where you would like 
	to add the Component, and select the 'add component' action.  This will enable you to choose any 
	Component, Glyph, or Ligature to place in the currently selected glyph as a Component Instance.
