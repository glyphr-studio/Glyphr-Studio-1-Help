<h1>Character - Attributes Panel</h1>

<p><i>(Character Edit and Ligatures Pages)</i></p>

<p>
	When no shape is selected, the Attributes Panel shows attributes for the currently
	selected Character.
</p>

<h2>Bulk-transform character shapes</h2>

<p>
	If there are more than one shape in the character, there are position and
	dimension controls that will change all the shapes in the character.
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		<b>X Position</b> - 
		the farthest-left Position of the character
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>Y Position</b> - 
		the most-top position of the character
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>Width</b> - 
		the overall width of the character
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>Height</b> - 
		the overall height of the character
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>Lock Aspect Ratio</b> - 
		this will force width and height changes to happen proportionally
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>Flip Vertical / Flip Horizontal</b> - 
		flip the entire character
	</li>
</ul>

<h2>Width Metrics</h2>

<p>
	These metrics are used for exporting a font file
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		<b>Character Width</b> - 
		by default, Glyphr Studio automatically calculates the width of a character. By unchecking the
		'automatically calculate' checkbox, you can manually set the character width.
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>Left and Right Side Bearing</b> - 
		This is a small amount of space that is automatically added before and after all
		characters. There is a global default that is applied to all characters, but
		if you want to specify a custom side bearing for a certain character, uncheck
		the 'use default' checkbox here.
	</li>
</ul>
