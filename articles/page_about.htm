	Displays various information
	about the currently loaded Glyphr Project, and the current Glyphr Studio being

<h2>Support the cause!</h2>

	Please consider making a 	contribution to the Glyphr Studio effort. Glyphr Studio is, and 
	will always, be totally free... but it does take some cash money to keep it going.
