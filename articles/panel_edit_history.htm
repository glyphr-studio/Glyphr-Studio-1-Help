<h1>Edit History Panel</h1>

<p><i>(Character Edit, Ligatures, Linked Shapes, and Kerning Pages)</i></p>

<p>
	This panel shows a list of edits that are available to
	undo. There is a small description of the action, along with a timestamp, and
	these actions are grouped by Character name. Pressing the 'Undo' button, or
	Ctrl+z will reverse edits that are listed here.
</p>


<p>
	Character Edit, Ligatures, and Linked Shapes pages all
	have separate undo lists. The Edit History Panel will only show edits that
	have taken place on that particular page, not across Glyphr Studio as a whole.
