<h1>Edit History Panel</h1>

<p><i>(Glyph Edit, Components, Ligatures, and Kerning Pages)</i></p>

<p>
	<img src="img/panel_history.png">
	This panel shows a list of edits that are available to
	undo. There is a description of the action, along with a timestamp, and
	these actions are grouped by glyph name. Pressing the 'Undo' button, or
	Ctrl+z will reverse edits that are listed here.
</p>


<p>
	Glyph Edit, Components, and Ligatures pages all
	have separate undo lists. The Edit History Panel will only show edits that
	have taken place on that particular page, not across Glyphr Studio as a whole.
