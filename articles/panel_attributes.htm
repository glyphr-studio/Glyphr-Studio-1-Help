<h1>Attributes Panel</h1>

<p><i>(Character Edit, Ligatures, Linked Shapes, Kerning, and Test Drive Pages)</i></p>

<p>
	The Attributes Panel is comprised of many sub-panels, depending on what is selected. 
	If no shapes are selected, it displays the <a class="articlelink" href="panel_character.html">Character Panel</a>, 
	with character level options, and bulk-edit options for all shapes in that character.
</p>

<p>
	If a shape or path point is selected, the Attributes Panel will display the 
	<a class="articlelink" href="panel_shape.html">Shape Panel</a>, the 
	<a class="articlelink" href="panel_path_point.html">Path Point Panel</a>, and/or the 
	<a class="articlelink" href="panel_linked_shape_instance.html">Linked Shape Instance Panel</a>.
</p>

<p> 
	The Attributes Panel also shows the Actions Panel, which displays actions that can be taken 
	on the currently selected shape or point.  There are also a few global actions that can be taken 
	even if nothing is selected.
