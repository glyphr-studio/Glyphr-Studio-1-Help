<h1>Component Instance - Attributes Panel</h1>

<p><i>(Glyph Edit, Components, and Ligatures Pages)</i></p>

<h3>Component Instance</h3>
<ul>
	<li>
		<b>Instance Name</b> - 
		Any name you want to give this Component Instance. Can be different than the Root Component 
		name.
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>&#916;X / &#916;Y</b> - 
		These coordinates are used to move the Component Instance 
		to a new location. These are delta values, meaning they are
		relative to the position of the Root Component.
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>&#916;Width / &#916;Height</b> - 
		These dimensions are used to re-size the Component Instance.  These are delta values, meaning 
		they are relative to the size of the Root Component.
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>Lock Aspect Ratio</b> - 
		Selecting this checkbox will cause the Component Instance to be re-sized proportionally.
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>Flip Horizontal / Flip Vertical</b> - 
		The Component Instance will be flipped relative to the Root Component.
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>Reverse Winding</b> - 
		All shapes in the Component Instance will have their windings reversed.  The clockwise or 
		counterclockwise direction of Path Points along a Path determine if that shape will 
		additively or subtractively overlap with other shapes in the glyph.
	</li>
</ul>

<h3>Root Component</h3>
<p>
	The Root Component is shown in the Attributes Panel for every Component Instance.  Clicking on 
	the Root Component thumbnail or name will navigate to that glyph so you can edit it.
