<h1>Character Edit Page</h1>

<p>
Character Edit, Ligatures, and Linked Shapes pages have many shape editing controls in
common. Linked Shapes are single outlines that can be inserted into many
characters of a font. Updating the Linked Shape will also update all the
Linked Shape instances. Characters and Ligatures in your font can have many
shapes (both linked and not), so there is an added concept of Layers on the
Character Edit and Ligatures pages.
</p>

<p>
Linked Shapes are individual shapes that can be added to many Characters or Ligatures.
Any time the Linked Shape is edited, all the Characters or Ligatures that use
that Linked Shape are updated. There are many individual letter forms that are
shared across characters in a single font - for example the round o form of the
letters b,d,g,o,p,q. Linked Shapes were designed to make it easy to keep
similar letter forms consistent across a font.

<p>
Creating new Linked Shapes, and adding a Linked Shape to a character can be done through
the Actions list in the Attributes Panel. The Linked Shapes page is very
similar to the Character Edit page. Each Linked Shape is just a single Shape,
so there are no shape layers, or add shape buttons. The Linked Shapes page also
displays all the shapes that use the current Linked Shape - they are displayed
as a thumbnail in the lower left, and update as the Linked Shape is edited.
Clicking on one of these thumbnails will navigate to the Character Edit or
Ligature page for that character.
