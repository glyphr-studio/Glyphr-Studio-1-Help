<h1>Shapes Panel</h1>

	<img src="img/panel_shapes.png">
	The Shapes Panel shows all the shapes in a glyph.  When clicking on an area with overlapping 
	shapes on the Edit Canvas, the upper-most shape in the stack will be selected.  For 
	glyphs with many shapes, sometimes it is easier to select a shape from the Shapes Panel 
	than it is from the Edit Canvas. 
</p>

<p>
 	Shapes can be multi-selected by holding down the control key, and either clicking on a shape
 	on the Edit Canvas, or by clicking on a shape in the Shapes Panel.
</p>

<p>
	The currently selected shape(s) will have a blue accent color.  If the shape happens to be a Component 
	Instance, then it will have a green selection color.  Component Instances will have an 
	additional note on that Shape's row indicating to which Root Component it is linked.
</p>

<p>
	A few shape and layer actions are also available from the Shapes Panel.  For the most part, where 
	a shape is in the stack will not affect the overall glyph.  But, if you want, you can 
	move shapes up and down the layer stack via layer actions.
