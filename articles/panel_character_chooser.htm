	The Character Chooser Panel displays characters that are available to be selected.  On the
	Character Edit or Ligatures pages, selecting a character from the Chooser Panel will load the 
	Edit Canvas with whatever character you selected.  On the Import SVG page, selecting a 
	character from the Chooser Panel determines where your imported SVG shape outlines will be 
	placed.
