<p>
	Kerning allows you to adjust the distance between two
	specific characters, or two sets of characters. Many characters look odd if
	they appear together using default spacing - for example, A and V. The space
	between these two characters is usually reduced with kerning so they 'fit'
	better together.
</p>


<p>
	The left or right side of the kern pair can also be a
	group of letters. For instance, you may decide to kern the letter A on the
	left with V, W, and Y on the right. This effectively creates three individual
	kern pairs: AV, AW, and AY.
</p>


<p>
	The Kerning Pairs attributes panel shows a list of all
	the existing kern pairs. The blue rectangle on the left of each line shows
	which one is currently selected. Specific kern values can be entered in the input
	on the right of each line, or by clicking and dragging on the edit canvas
	itself. There is a 'x' button on the far right of each line to delete that
	kern pair.
