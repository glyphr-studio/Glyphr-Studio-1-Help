X Position - the farthest-left position
of the character
</li>
<li>
Y Position - the most-top position of
the character
</li>
<li>
Width - the overall width of the
character
</li>
<li>
Height - the overall height of the
character
</li>
<li>
Lock Aspect Ratio - this will force
width and height changes to happen proportionally
</li>
<li>
Flip Vertical / Flip Horizontal - flip
the entire character
</li>
</ul>

<h2>
Width Metrics
</h2>

<p>
These metrics are used for exporting a font file
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Character Width - by default, Glyphr
Studio automatically calculates the width of a character. By unchecking the
'automatically calculate' checkbox, you can manually set the character width.
</li>
<li>
Left and Right Side Bearing - This is a
small amount of space that is automatically added before and after all
characters. There is a global default that is applied to all characters, but
if you want to specify a custom side bearing for a certain character, uncheck
the 'use default' checkbox here.
</li>
</ul>
