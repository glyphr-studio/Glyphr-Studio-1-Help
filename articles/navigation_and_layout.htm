<h1>Navigation and Layout</h1>

<p>
The Glyphr Studio work space has three vertical areas: from left to right, the
Navigation Bar, the Panel, and the Main Content area. Selecting an icon in the
Navigation Bar will update the Panel and the Main Content areas. Pressing the Glyphr
Studio logo in the upper left part of the Navigation Bar displays all the main
pages in the Panel, allowing you to navigate around Glyphr Studio.
</p>

<p>
Some of the pages have additional Navigation Bar icons - like Attributes, Layers, and
Character Selection - that are specific to character editing, or other activities. 
</p>

<p>
The bottom-most icon in the Navigation Bar is a save icon - it does not actually
navigate anywhere, but instead is just an omnipresent shortcut to save your
Glyphr Project. When there are changes that have not been saved, the save icon
becomes slightly highlighted, and a diamond icon &#10070; will be added to the browser title.
