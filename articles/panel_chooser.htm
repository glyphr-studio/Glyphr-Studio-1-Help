	The Chooser Panel displays characters that are available to be selected.  On the
	Glyph Edit, Components, or Ligatures pages, selecting a glyph from the Chooser Panel will load the 
	Edit Canvas with whatever glyph you selected.  On the Import SVG page, selecting a 
	glyph from the Chooser Panel determines where your imported SVG shape outlines will be 
	placed.
