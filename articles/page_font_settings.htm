<h1>Font Settings Page</h1>

<p>
<b>Font Name </b>will be used when exporting your font.
</p>

<p>
<b>Glyph Proportions</b> deal
with global attributes that affect your font. Glyphr Studio uses the
properties in the Font Settings section to display and edit shapes:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Key Metrics - By default, glyphs have a total height of 1000 Units,
called Em Units. The baseline of that glyph splits the upper and lower
portions of the glyph vertically. Input an Ascent Height, and the Descent
Height will be calculated automatically. X Height and Cap Height are common
guides for lowercase and uppercase letters in your font. 
These metrics may be used to scale imported SVG outlines.<br>
<b>Important: It is highly recommended that Units per Em either be 1000, or a power of 2 (like 1024 or 2048). 
UPM values other than these run a risk of not working with some applications.</b><br>
</li>
<li>
Default Side Bearing - All glyphs have a small amount of
space to their left and right that separates them from another glyphs. Individual
Side Bearings can be edited in the Attributes Panel of that glyph. But, to
make things easier, if a specific Left or Right Side Bearing is not set, this
Default Side Bearing will be applied.
</li>
</ul>

<h2>
Grids and Guides
</h2>

<ul>
<li>
Grid System - Divide your Em square into a specified number of
sub-units. This will show up as a light gray grid behind your glyph
editing canvas.
</li>
<li>
Overshoot - Round glyphs are usually slightly larger than
their square counterparts so that they visually look the same size. Specify an
overshoot measurement here. Note: this metric may be used to scale imported
SVG outlines.
</li>
</ul>


<h2>
Glyph Ranges
</h2>

<ul>
<li>
Standard Glyph Ranges are a list of the four basic
Latin glyph ranges that can be specified for fonts. These common ranges
can be enabled or disabled with a checkbox, and their Unicode range values will
automatically be added to your Glyphr Studio project.
</li>
<li>
Custom Glyph Ranges can also be added to projects. If
you want to design glyphs that don't fall into the common Latin glyph
ranges above, you can specify a new range here. You'll have to look up the
starting and ending Unicode values for the range you want to work with.
</li>
</ul>


<p>
<b>Font Metadata </b>is a set of
information that describes your font in various ways, and specifies some extra
options - like underline and strikethrough attributes. These attributes are split 
up into two sections: OTF properties will be exported to .otf font files, and SVG 
properties will be exported with SVG Font files. 
</p>
