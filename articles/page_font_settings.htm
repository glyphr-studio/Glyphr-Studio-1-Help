<h1>Font Settings Page</h1>

<p>
<b>Font Name </b>will be used when exporting your font.
</p>

<p>
<b>Character Proportions</b> deal
with global attributes that affect your font. Glyphr Studio uses the
properties in the Font Settings section to display and edit shapes:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Key Metrics - Characters have a total height of 1000 Units,
called Em Units. The baseline of that character splits the upper and lower
portions of the character vertically. Input an Ascent Height, and the Descent
Height will be calculated automatically. X Height and Cap Height are common
guides for lowercase and uppercase letters in your font.

Note: these metrics may be used to scale imported SVG outlines.
</li>
<li>
Default Side Bearing - All characters have a small amount of
space to their left and right that separates them from another characters. Individual
Side Bearings can be edited in the Attributes Panel of that character. But, to
make things easier, if a specific Left or Right Side Bearing is not set, this
Default Side Bearing will be applied.
</li>
</ul>

<h2>
Grids and Guides
</h2>

<ul>
<li>
Grid System - Divide your Em square into a specified number of
sub-units. This will show up as a light gray grid behind your character
editing canvas.
</li>
<li>
Overshoot - Round characters are usually slightly larger than
their square counterparts so that they visually look the same size. Specify an
overshoot measurement here. Note: this metric may be used to scale imported
SVG outlines.
</li>
</ul>


<h2>
Character Ranges
</h2>

<ul>
<li>
Standard Character Ranges are a list of the four basic
Latin character ranges that can be specified for fonts. These common ranges
can be enabled or disabled with a checkbox, and their Unicode range values will
automatically be added to your Glyphr Studio project.
</li>
<li>
Custom Character Ranges can also be added to projects. If
you want to design characters that don't fall into the common Latin character
ranges above, you can specify a new range here. You'll have to look up the
starting and ending Unicode values for the range you want to work with.
</li>
</ul>


<p>
<b>Font Metadata </b>is a set of
information that describes your font in various ways, and specifies some extra
options - like underline and strikethrough attributes. These attributes are
exported with your SVG font.
