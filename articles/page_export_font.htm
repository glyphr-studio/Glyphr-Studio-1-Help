<h1>Export Font Page</h1>

<p>
	Glyphr Studio is able to export a project to two different Font File formats: Open Type (.otf) 
	fonts and SVG Fonts (.svg).  More information about specific file formats can be found in the 
	<a class="articlelink" href="overview_file_formats.html">File Formats</a> article.
</p>

<p>
	If you want to, there are options on the <a class="articlelink" href="pages_project_settings.html">
	Project Settings Page</a> that will allow you to pin an 'Export OTF' and/or an 'Export SVG' 
	buttons on the Nav Bar.  If you find yourself often exporting a font, these buttons are more 
	accessible than navigating to the Export Font page.
