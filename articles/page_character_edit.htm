<p>
	Character Edit is where most of your font creation time will be spent.  Each character in your 
	font is comprised of many shapes.  Shapes are closed outlines or paths, comprised of many path 
	points.  More on shape editing can be found on the <a class="articlelink" href="editing_shape_editing.html">
	shape editing</a> page.
</p>

<p>
	Depending on what shape or path point is selected, the <a class="articlelink" href="editing_shape_editing.html">
	shape attribute panel</a> or the <a class="articlelink" href="panel_path_point.html">path point 
	attribute panel</a> will show editable attributes and actions.  Many of these attributes, like 
	x/y position, can either be edited from the attributes panel, or changed directly on the edit canvas.
</p>

<p>
	If you want to add or remove certain characters from your font, you can do so on the 
	<a class="articlelink" href="page_font_settings.html">font settings page</a>.
