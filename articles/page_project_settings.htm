This information does not
necessarily have a direct effect on the Font itself, but is used to help with
designing your font. This information is saved when a Glyphr Project is saved,
and will be imported when a saved project is loaded.

<ul>
<li>Project Name - Initially,
this project name is used as the Font Name as well. But, the Glyphr Project
can have a different name from the Font itself, which can be edited here.
</li>
<li>UI Behavior - this is a
set of options that you can adjust that will change how some UI controls
behave.
