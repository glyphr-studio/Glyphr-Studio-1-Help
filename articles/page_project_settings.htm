<h1>Project Settings Page</h1>

<p>
	The properties on the Project Settings Page do not 
	necessarily have a direct effect on the Font itself, but is used to help with
	designing your font. This information is saved when a Glyphr Studio Project is saved,
	and will be imported when a saved project is loaded. 
</p>

<ul>
<li>
	<b>Project Name</b> - 
	Initially, this project name is used as the Font Name as well. But, your Glyphr 
	Studio Project can have a different name from the Font itself, which can be edited here.
</li>
<li>
	<b>UI Behavior</b> - 
	These are options that you can adjust that will change how some UI controls behave.
