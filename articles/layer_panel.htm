<h1>Layer Panel</h1>

<p><i>(Character Edit and Ligatures Pages)</i></p>

<p>
	The Layer Panel shows all the shapes in a character.  When selecting an area with overlapping 
	shapes on the Edit Canvas, the upper-most shape in the layer stack will be selected.  For 
	characters with many shapes, sometimes it is easier to select a shape from the Layers Panel 
	than it is from the Edit Canvas. 
</p>

<p>
	The currently selected shape will have a blue accent color.  If the shape happens to be a Linked 
	Shape Instance, then it will have a green selection color.  Linked Shape Instances will have an 
	additional note on the layer row indicating to which Linked Shape it is linked.
</p>

<p>
	A few shape and layer actions are also available from the Layer Panel.  For the most part, where 
	a shape is in the layer stack will not affect the overall character.  But, if you want, you can 
	move shapes up and down the layer stack via layer actions.
