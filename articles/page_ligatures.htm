<p>
	Ligatures are when two or more characters get combined into one glyph.  Generically, 
	when you define a ligature, two or more characters are specified, and instead of showing 
	those characters when a user is typing, those characters get replaced with a single new character.
</p>
<p>
	Some common lowercase ligatures involve combining the crossbars of characters like f and t, 
	forming ligatures like &#64256; and &#64261;.  A common uppercase ligature is combining the characters 
	A and E into the ligature &AElig;.  Ligatures can also be used for any other sequence replacement, 
	for example fractions: the three characters 1 and / and 4 could be turned into the ligature &frac14;.  
</p>
<p>
	Creating a new ligature is as easy as specifying two or more characters to combine.  
	Designing the resulting character uses exactly the same tools and processes as designing 
	regular characters on the Character Edit page.
