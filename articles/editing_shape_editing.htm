<h1>Shape Editing</h1>

<p>
	Shape editing concepts can be found on the Glyph Edit, Ligatures, and Components
	pages. Editing a shape can happen on the Edit Canvas using 
	<a class="articlelink" href="editing_canvas_tools.html">canvas tools</a>, from the keyboard using 
	<a class="articlelink" href="editing_keyboard_shortcuts.html">keyboard shortcuts</a>, or by using 
	controls in a Panel.
