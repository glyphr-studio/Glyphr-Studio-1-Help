<h1>Linked Shapes Page</h1>

<p>
	Linked Shapes are shapes that you define once, and can be added to many characters.  If you edit 
	the original Linked Shape, it also updates in all the characters where it was inserted.  
</p>
	
<p>
	For example, you could define an 'o' shape, and insert a Linked Shape Instance to the characters 
	'abdgopq'.  This can help in the beginning phases of font design to rough out common shapes
	across an entire set of characters.
</p>

<p>
	Editing a Linked Shape uses all the same <a class="articlelink" href="editing_shape_editing.html">shape 
	editing</a> concepts that characters do, except there is only one shape allowed per Linked Shape.
</p>

<h2>Linking and Un-linking</h2>

<p>
	Linked Shapes can be added to a character either from the Linked Shapes page, or from the 
	Character Edit page.  Once you have a Linked Shape Instance in a character, it can be un-linked. 
	This essentially makes a copy of the original Linked Shape and places it in the character as a 
	regular shape.  In the later phases of font design, this can be useful for final tweaks.  Many 
	shapes between characters feel similar, but are slightly different.
</p>

<p>
	Alternatively, if you are creating a shape in a character and decide you would like to use it 
	in other characters as a Linked Shape, you can do so by selecting the shape and selecting the 
	'turn into a linked shape' action.  This will add a new entry to the Linked Shapes page, and 
	turn the currently selected shape into a Linked Shape Instance.
