is currently selected. 0 is the first Path Point.
</li>
<li>
Point Type - Each Path Point has two
handles that control the curve of the path before and after it. There are three
kinds of Point Types: Corner (Handles can be anywhere), Flat (Handles will be
in line with each other), and Symmetric (Handles will be in-line with each
other and equidistant from the Path Point).
</li>
<li>
Point X / Point Y - The Path Point's coordinates. These
attributes are set in Em Units. These attributes are lockable.
<li>
Use Handle 1 / Use Handle 2 - Deselecting
the checkbox by the handle title will remove the handle, such that it will not
impact the curvature of the path. These options are only available for Flat
and Corner point types.
</li>
<li>
Handle 1 X/Y &amp; Handle 2 X/Y - The
Handle's
coordinates. These attributes are set in Em Units. These attributes are
lockable.
</li>
<li>
Handle 1 Angle / Handle 2 Angle - read-only
degree of the handle away from an imaginary horizontal line drawn through the
point. Zero degrees is to the left, 180 degrees to the right.
</li>
</ul>
