<h1>Shape Editing</h1>

<p>
	Shape editing concepts can be found on the Character Edit, Ligatures, and Linked Shapes
	pages. Editing a shape can happen on the Edit Canvas using 
	<a class="articlelink" href="canvas_tools.html">canvas tools</a>, from the keyboard using 
	<a class="articlelink" href="keyboard_shortcuts.html">keyboard shortcuts</a>, or by using 
	controls in a Panel.

<h2>Panels</h2>
<ul>
	<li>
		The <a class="articlelink" href="character_panel.html">Character Panel</a> 
		displays all the characters in the font.  Selecting a character allows you to edit it on 
		the Edit Canvas.  You can add or remove characters from your font via the 
		<a class="articlelink" href="font_settings_page.html">font settings page</a>.
	</li>
	<li>
		The <a class="articlelink" href="layer_panel.html">Layer Panel</a> shows all the shapes in 
		the selected character.  You can select a shape by clicking on it on the Edit Canvas, or by 
		clicking on it's row on the Layer Panel.
	</li>
	<li>
		The Attributes Panel is comprised of many sub-panels, depending on what is selected. It can 
		contain the <a class="articlelink" href="shape_panel.html">Shape Panel</a>, the 
		<a class="articlelink" href="path_point_panel.html">Path Point Panel</a>, and/or the 
		<a class="articlelink" href="linked_shape_instance_panel.html">Linked Shape Instance Panel</a>.

		on the currently selected shape or point.

		The <a class="articlelink" href="edit_history_panel.html">Edit History Panel</a> shows a list
