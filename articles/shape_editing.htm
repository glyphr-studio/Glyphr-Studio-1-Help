<h1>Shape Editing</h1>

<p>
Shape editing
concepts can be found on the Character Edit, Ligatures, and Linked Shapes
pages. Shape and Path attributes, along with metadata, can be edited either in
the Attributes Panel, or interactively using the Edit Canvas in the Content
Area. 
</p>

<p>
Many of
these attributes can be locked by selecting the small lock icon to the left of
the attribute value. This will stop this attribute from accidentally being
changed, and in most cases, will limit what can be done on the Edit Canvas.
</p>

<p>
Unless otherwise noted, most attributes are in Em units.
