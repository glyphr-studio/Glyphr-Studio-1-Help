<h1>Test Drive Page</h1>

<p>
The Test Drive page is where your
font can be tried out in real time. Typing in the upper textbox will display
that same text in your font face in the lower box.

<p>
In the Attributes Panel, there is
a list of Pangram buttons that will populate the upper textbox with sentences
that contain all the letters of the alphabet. Similarly, there are buttons that
will populate the upper textbox with certain character sets.

<p>
The Options area lets you change
how your font is drawn to the lower box, including options for Font Size, Line
Spacing, and Character Spacing.

<p>
The 'Generate PNG File' button will launch a new tab
with an image of whatever is displayed in the lower box. Right-click the image
to save the PNG file.
