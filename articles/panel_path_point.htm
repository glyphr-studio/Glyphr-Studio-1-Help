<h1>Path Point - Attributes Panel</h1>

<p><i>(Character Edit, Ligatures, and Linked Shape Pages)</i></p>

<ul>
	<li>
		<b>Selected Point</b> - 
		Displays which point is currently selected. 0 is the first Path Point.
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>Point Type</b> - 
		Each Path Point has two	handles that control the curve of the path before and after it. 
		There are three	kinds of Point Types: Corner (Handles can be anywhere), Flat (Handles will be
		in line with each other), and Symmetric (Handles will be in-line with each
		other and equidistant from the Path Point).
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>Point X / Point Y</b> - 
		The Path Point's coordinates. These	attributes are set in Em Units. These attributes are lockable.
	<li>
		<b>Use Handle 1 / Use Handle 2</b> - 
		Deselecting	the checkbox by the handle title will remove the handle, such that it will not
		impact the curvature of the path. These options are only available for Flat
		and Corner point types.
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>Handle 1 X/Y &amp; Handle 2 X/Y</b> - 
		The	Handle's coordinates. These attributes are set in Em Units. These attributes are
		lockable.
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>Handle 1 Angle / Handle 2 Angle</b> - 
		read-only degree of the handle away from an imaginary horizontal line drawn through the
		point. Zero degrees is to the left, 180 degrees to the right.
	</li>
</ul>
